     Consider only streamflow values y, which are part of a recession
     period, and assume you draw a scatter plot of y(i+1) against y(i).
     If all assumptions were perfectly fullfilled, then all points in
     the scatter plot would lie on a straight line with slope a. Yet, 
     in reality this is not the case. Such a scatter plot shows that 
     the recession between y(i) and y(i+1) can assume quite different 
     speeds.
     Baseflow, however, can be characterised as the most slowly recessing
     streamflow component. This means that the baseflow recession is 
     described by those points, which form the upper bound of the scatter
     plot. Indeed, it is found that these points lie almost on a straight 
     line. Therefore, the recession constant can be found as the slope of
     a straight line, which is fitted to the upper bound of the scatter
     plot.
