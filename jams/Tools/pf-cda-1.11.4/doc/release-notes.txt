=======================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.11.4 ( December 3, 2008 )

* Added DARC client API to Javadoc

* Changed loading of cda.properties from URL-based loading to
  file based loading because on Linux systems Java might use 
  an FTP URL Handler for URLs starting with "file://".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.11.3 ( October 5, 2008 )

* Added "Cancel" button to initialization progress dialog.

* BUGFIX: When closing a workset while initialization is still running
  an exception occurred.

* BUGFIX: BCEL
  Exceptions similar to the following should not occur anymore:

  org.apache.bcel.classfile.ClassFormatException: Invalid constant pool
  reference: 6144. Constant pool size is: 146  

* BUGFIX: BCEL
  Exceptions similar to the following should not occur anymore:

  java.io.IOException: Too much bytes to be allocated on heap for Unknown: 2471
        at org.apache.bcel.classfile.Unknown.<init>(Unknown.java:143)
        at org.apache.bcel.classfile.Attribute.readAttribute(Attribute.java:201)
        at org.apache.bcel.classfile.ClassParser.readAttributes(ClassParser.java:228)
        at org.apache.bcel.classfile.ClassParser.parse(ClassParser.java:184)
        at org.pf.tools.cda.dependency.analyzer.ClassFileAnalyzer.analyze(ClassFileAnalyzer.java:152)

* Updated libraries
  - bcel.jar 5.1-A1.2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.11.2 ( September 14, 2008 )

* BUGFIX
  Referred classes that have not been found in the defined classpath
  are now again added to the special "Not Found" (N/A) container.

* In the workset wizard the "Display Filter" and "Ignore Filter" tabs
  now support "Activate All" and "Deactivate All" buttons.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.11.1 ( September 13, 2008 )

* Better exception handling and logging during class file analysis

* Fixed cda.bat and cda.sh

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.11 ( June 29, 2008 )

* Introduced the Dependency Analyzer Remote Control (DARC).
  It allows other Java applications to utilize CDA functionality via
  remote calls and work further on the returned results.

* BUGFIX
  There was a memory leak when a workset was closed. The loaded container
  package and class objects could not been removed by the GC.
  No the references are released and GC can clean-up properly.  

* Full name of selected element in tree is now shown in status line.
  
* After changing a workset definition it gets now saved before analyzing
  its claspath.
  
* Using newer version of libraries
  - pf.jar V3.8.1
  - pf-mvc.jar V2.8

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.10 ( February 15, 2008 )

* All DTD files (workset-1.6.dtd, odem-1.1.dtd) are now declared by
  a public logical name and a URI that points to the file location 
  in the web.
  That should simplify validation of the corresponding XML files.
  > http://dependency-analyzer.org/schema/dtd/workset-1.6.dtd
  > http://pfsw.org/ODEM/schema/dtd/odem-1.1.dtd

* CDA now supports ODEM/XML file in a workset's classpath.
  That means, all dependency analysis can be executed also on ODEM/XML 
  files alone or together with Java binaries.

* Export of XML files now appends automatically file extension ".odem"
  to file name.
  
* After editing a workset with the workset wizard a re-initialization
  of the classes and their dependencies will now be executed only if
  any data has been changed that might have an impact on this 
  initialization. That is, any of the the "Variables", "Classpath" or 
  "Ignore Filters" has been changed.
  
* A progress monitor window is shown now during the whole initialization
  process of a workset. There is a progress window per workset.

* Windows showing circular dependencies graph and table now support Ctrl+C
  to copy the selected rows in table to the clipboard.
  
* BUGFIX
  If class java.lang.Object was not excluded from analysis by an 
  Ignore Filter then it could happen that in hierarchy graph views
  this class was shown multiple times.
  Now it is ensured that java.lang.Object will be shown only once.
  
* BUGFIX
  When a table was scrolled vertically or horizontically the popup menu
  showed up far away from the mouse pointer (at bottom or right side 
  of window).
  Now the popup menu in tables shows up at the current mouse pointer 
  position.
  
* BUGFIX
  When a graph window is opened on two different worksets but for the same 
  class then the first one is reused an brought to front.
  Corrected behaviour is to have the graph view opened per workset.

* Using newer version of libraries
  - pf.jar V3.7
  - pf-odem.jar V0.5
  - pf-mvc.jar V2.7
  - forms-1.1.0.jar
  - looks-2.1.4.jar
  - y.jar V2.4.0.3
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.9.1 ( August 16, 2007 )

* Container elements can now be marked as "Third Party Library".
  That is helpful in some cases where such libraries should be excluded
  from the analysis.

* Supports now detection of circular dependencies with several options
  to ignore special cases (e.g. third party libraries, cycles in the
  same package, ...)

* For classes and packages it is now possible to show the "distance" of
  the dependencies by separate colors.
  That is,
  class-to-class dependency where both classes in the same package: green
  class-to-class dependency where the classes in different packages: blue
  class-to-class dependency where the classes in different containers: red

  package-to-package dependency where both packages in the same container: blue
  package-to-package dependency where the packages in different containers: red

* Input dialog for classpath elements now provides help text for 
  pattern usage.

* BUGFIX:
  When installing CDA in a folder that contains a space (e.g. Program Files),
	Toolbar icons do not show.
	Following stacktrace appears:
	
	Loading configuration from file:/C:/Program Files/pf-cda-1.9/config/cda.properties
	E Failed to load config file: cda_ui.xml
	java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\Program%20Files\pf-cda-1.9\pf-cda-swing.jar\cda_ui.xml
	        at org.pf.file.FileLocator.getInputStream(FileLocator.java:422)
	        at org.pf.tools.cda.ui.UserInterfaceConfigurer.readConfigFile(Unknown Source)
	        at org.pf.tools.cda.ui.UserInterfaceConfigurer.initFrom(Unknown Source)
	        at org.pf.tools.cda.ui.UserInterfaceConfigurer.<init>(Unknown Source)

  ==> Fixed by using new pf.jar 3.6.1 which includes bugfix for proper
      URL encoding/decoding

* BUGFIX: Avoid NPE in Drag&Drop functionality
  java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.pf.tools.cda.ui.dnd.AnalyzableElementTransferHandler.canImport(AnalyzableElementTransferHandler.java:71)
	at javax.swing.TransferHandler$DropHandler.dragEnter(TransferHandler.java:651)
	at java.awt.dnd.DropTarget.dragEnter(DropTarget.java:337)
	  
* XML file export now adds new attributes isFinal="yes", isAbstract="yes" and
  visibility="public" to <type> tag.

* Using newer version of libraries
  - pf.jar V3.6.1
  - pf-odem.jar V0.4

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.9 ( April 8, 2007 )

* Plug-in API defined
  --> Generalized model: Object Dependency Exploration Model (ODEM)
  --> Extension points (custom window, model export)
  --> Javadoc
  --> Developer Guide

* "Find Dependants" feature is now also available on
  > Packages
  > Containers

* A new feature to find all duplicate classes is now available via the
  popup menu on a workest node in the tree view.

* The container for all classes that have not been found is now also
  shown in the tree view.

* The display filter can be activated/deactivated per container in the
  tree view.
  
* The new generic API for dependency analysis 
  ODEM (Object Dependency Exploration Model)
  is now supported by CDA. 

* Supports now hiding/showing and auto positioning of main window.
	That means, right half of split-screen gets shrinked away and window
  gets positioned to the left of the screen. (Use Alt+W)

* All sub-windows now provide a toolbar button that moves the main window 
  to front.

* Class overview pages show now the class file version and minimum 
  required JVM version
  
* On package, container and workset level highest class file version and
  corresponding minimum required JVM version of the contained classes are shown
  .  
* In all table windows a toolbar button was added that allows to open a 
  graph view on the elements shown in the table 

* In the dependency path tracking graph it is now also possible via popup menu to
  - select the current element in the tree view of the main window
  - open a new graph view window on the current element 

* In package and container graphs it is now possible select whether to open the 
  details information on a dependency in a graph or a table window

* Avoid duplicate container (i.e. JARs, folders) when assempling the classpath 
  elements

* With the new configuration parameter 'ui.graph.dependency.paths.threshold' 
  it is now possible to define a threshold for the number of dpendency paths 
  to be shown in a graph without warning.
	The warning will be shown if that threshold is exceeded. However, the user can
	still decide to continue with creating the dpendency graph.

* BUGFIX: 
  Dropping elements to a graph from a different workset are now prevented!

* BUGFIX:
  In some cases (particular with worksets containing many classes) the 
  following exception occured:
  java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
		at java.util.AbstractList$Itr.checkForComodification(AbstractList.java:448)
		at java.util.AbstractList$Itr.next(AbstractList.java:419)
		at org.pf.tools.cda.model.ClassContainer.findPackage(ClassContainer.java:482)

	That was because the background process which did the class file analyzing for 
	all classes was not yet finished. A simultaneously started analysis (thread)
	on the dependencies now collided with that background thread.
	Proper synchronization whould have been an option. But the overhead would 
	slow down class file analysis even further.
	
	So from now on dependency analysis can be executed NOT before all class files
	have been	loaded and analyzed.

* Upgraded to 
  > forms-1.0.7.jar
  > looks-2.1.2.jar
  > pf.jar V3.6
  > pf-joi.jar V2.3
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.8.1 ( December 16, 2006 )

* BUGFIX: Some classes or dependency arrows where missing in hierarchy 
  graph.

* BUGFIX: In the tree view with container names the number of classes 
  has not been shown anymore if "short container names" option were selected.

* BUGFIX: Table in "Edit Filter" dialog didn't resize correctly when
  dialog window was resized.

* BUGFIX: "Edit Filter" dialog wasn't modal and therefore disappeard
  behind the main window whenever an input dialog for a new or editing
  an existing filter entry was opened.
  Now the dialog is modal.

* BUGFIX: Recognizing static class array definitions like 
  org.pf.tools.cda.model.Element[].class
  produced class entrys with a name like "[Lorg.pf.tools.cda.model.Element;"

* The Workset wizard now caches the last directory selection of its
  file dialog for classpath definitions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.8 ( December 1, 2006 )

* In some cases where classes are loaded via Class.forName(String)
  these classes are now recognized and added to the dependency list.

* The modifiers "public", "abstract" and "final" are now shown in the
  overview tab for a class.
  
* In graph views the names of abstract classes, interfaces, annotations 
  are now shown with ITALICS font style to distinguish them from 
  concrete classes.

* Various new settings in cda.properties
  > ui.graph.text.font
  > ui.graph.class.separate.package
  > ui.graph.class.show.icon
  > ui.graph.grid.size

* Some enhancements have been added to the overview tab 
  - There is now a button available to jump to the container and one to 
    jump to the package in the tree view.
  - On all levels the number of contained elements are shown
    (e.g. number of contained classes)

* In the tree view it is now possible to open various graph views on the
  currently selected 
  > class
  > package
  > container

* Workset wizard supports now proper resizing of window

* A new option in the classpath definition tab of the workset wizard
  allows to turn on/off whether container names should be displayed
  with their short names.

* Support of adding more elements (of the same type) to an opened 
  graph view by drag & drop

* Show details for the dependency between two packages (i.e. a list
  of all class dependency pairs that cause the package dependency)

* Show details for the dependency between two class containers 
  (i.e. a list of all class dependency pairs that cause the container 
  dependency)

* In a details list of dependencies it is supported to jump to the
  tree view for any class shown in the dependencies table

* Support COPY (Ctrl+C) in dependency details table

* Allow opening a graph on all containers of a workset

* Allow opening a graph on all packages of a container

* Allow opening a graph on all classes of a package

* On each element in a graph view it is possible via pop-up menu to 
  jump to the element in the tree view of the main window

* BUGFIX: Classes that are only referenced by ClassName.class 
  are now found and added to the dependency list.
  
* BUGFIX: Start background analyzer threads again if relevant changes
  of workset have been accepted/saved (e.g. classpath changed)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.7 ( October 13, 2006 )

* Changed graphics library from JGraph to yGraph (www.yworks.com)

* New supported features in dependency path tracker graph

  -jar option
  
* New version 1.3 of pf-ssgen bundled with CDA
  
* DEPENDENCY CHANGES
  
  > pf.jar 3.5.2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.6.2 ( September 1, 2006 )

* Bugfix: All JAR files have been kept open until CDA was terminated.
  Now the archives are closed after their contents has been analyzed.

* DEPENDENCY CHANGES
  
  > pf.jar 3.5.1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.6.1 ( July 8, 2006 )

* Bugfix: Closing a workset sometimes caused a NullPointerException

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.6 ( June 11, 2006 )

I) NEW FEATURES
  
  * New search function: Find all implementors of the selected interface.
    Opens up a new window with the list of all classes that implement
    the interface directly or indirectly.

  * New search function: Find direct implementors of the selected interface.
    Opens up a new window with the list of all classes that implement
    the interface directly.

  * New search function: Find direct dependants of selected class/interface.
    Opens up a new window with the list of all classes depending on
    the class or interface selected in the tree view.

  * In tables the selected rows now can be copied to the clipboard.
    The separator for the columns is a tabulator which allows to easily
    paste the contents to a spreadsheet like MS Excel or OpenOffice
    spreadsheet.
    However, the separator can be configured to a different value in
    cda.properties.
 
II) ENHANCEMENTS

  * Supports now all new Java 5 types in dependency analysis:
    > annotaions
    > enums
    > generics

  * Extreme performance optimization (class file analyzing reduced down
    to 17% of the time previous versions needed)
     
  * Running background thread (low prio) per workset to load class file
    information. Increases performance dramatically.
  
  * Added large icons for element type in overview tab

III) DEPENDENCY CHANGES
  
  * pf.jar 3.4 
  
  * pf-mvc.jar 2.3
  
  * bcel.jar (special version 5.1/A1.0 to support Java 5)

IV) BUGFIXES

  * Handle classes in default package (i.e. no package name) 
    correctly. Former versions failed to analyze such classes.

  * Analyzing Eclipse .classpath files didn't locate entries
    like kind="lib" path="/Project2/lib/xyz.jar" correctly.
  
  * There was a memory leak in the dependency table. For each
    change in the display options a new table model was added to internal
    observer list
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.5 ( April 2, 2006 )

* Uses pf.jar V3.3 now

* Supports export of a workset and all contained model objects to an
  XML file. It is also possible to just export a selected element in
  the tree view and all its children.

* Provides a plug-in mechanism for further model export implementations

* Added search function for containers and packages

* New configuration settings in cda.properties are supported
  - ui.dependency.display.filter.default
  - ui.dependency.graph.text.size

* Changed from resource bundles to NLS-ini files that support UTF-8

* A new global variable CDA_HOME is now automatically set to the
  directory where the cda-base.jar is located.
  That allows to use {CDA_HOME} to refer to the install dir of CDA.

* Changed example CDA.ws workset so that it will work on any
  machine (if it is still located under the install directory)

* Bugfix: Workset files are now properly saved with UTF-8 encoding.

* Support of automatic workset loading at startup.
  Can be disabled via the new property "workset.auto.loading".
  If active, all worksets that have been open at last CDA exit will
  automatically be reloaded if they have been marked as auto-reloadable.

* Bugfix: For an Eclipse classpath there was an uncatched 
  FileNotFoundException if a reference to a project in a different
  workspace was in the classpath.
  That's fixed now (at least for Eclipse 3.1.x it should be ok) 

* Bugfix: After analyzing an element it sometime happened that the 
  divider was set to the right window edge. That has hidden the whole
  right part (e.g. the dependency table).
  Now the divider will not change anymore.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.4.1 ( March 3, 2006 )

* Uses pf.jar V3.2.1 now

* Delivered now with Start Shell Script Generator V1.2 (pf-sssgen.jar)

* BUGFIX: On Unix systems neither the toolbar icons nor the hotkeys
  worked due to a bug in locating and reading config file "cda_ui.xml"
  
* BUGFIX: After saving a workset the state of "Save Workset" action 
  was not set to disabled.

* BUGFIX: Workset was not correctly refreshing its classpath elements
  if just a classpath variable has been modified.
  
* Added sssgen.sh

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.4 ( February 26, 2006 )

* Support for classpath calculation from Eclipse project's .classpath
  files.

* Container-Info now shows the type Java Archive or File Directory

* Container-Info now shows the contents of the manifest file if
  available

* Workset info now shows the number of all classes in the workset
  
* Bugfix: In previous version the extended interfaces of an interface
  have not been shown correctly

* Bugfix: GUI does not block anymore if during initial container 
  scanning the workset element is selected with the mouse

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.3 ( February 4, 2006 )

* Short info view for classes and interfacses now shows the superclass
  and all directly implemented interfaces with a button that allows to
  find for those referred classes in the tree view.

* Added toolbar with most important actions

* Loading a workset file (*.ws) does not require the file workset.dtd
  in the same directory anymore. The XML parser is not validating the
  workset file anymore.
  
* If there are problems with loading a workset file, now better error
  messages help to detect the reason.

* Supports now a selection history (per workset) that allows to
  navigate backward/forward (with Alt+Left, Alt+Right and toolbar) 
  through the slected elements in the tree.
  (currently limited to 10 entries).
  
* Supports ** in classpath definition to indicate recursive file lookup

* The dependency tracking view nows shows the different dependency
  types (extends, implements, refers to) in different arrow colors and 
  shapes.
  The colors are changed for better contrast and the icon representing
  a class or an interface gets displayed as well. 

* In the dependency tracking view class names are shortened at their
  beginning if they are getting too long to be read.
  
* For each selected element that can be analyzed the information view
  on the right half of the window is now a panel with two tabs.
  One for the "Overview" and one for the "Dependencies".
  That now allows to still see the overview even after the element
  has been analyzed.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.2 ( January 14, 2006 )

* Names of containers (archives) and packages in the tree view can now
  be limited to a specific length. If they exceed this length, the name
  will be reduced and the missing piece will be shown as "..." or "*".
  The maximum length can be specified in cda.properties by the properties
  - ui.tree.display.length.container
  - ui.tree.display.length.package
  
* The tree view now can show the number of classes in a package and in
  a container with the corresponding tree nodes.
  This feature can be switched on or off in cda.properties by property
  - ui.tree.show.class.count

* The progress of the background thread that's scanning the containers
  for included packages and classes now is shown in the status line
  at the bottom of the main window.
  
* When analyzing dependencies a progress monitor window is shown.
  It shows each class that gets currently analyzed and it allows to
  stop analysis with a cancel button.

* All supported hotkeys are now shown with their corresponding 
  menu items.

* The dependency table now gets resized when the window size is changed.

Known Bugs:

> Sometimes after analyzing a class, package or container the right
  half of the spit screen vanishes.
  If that happens, just move the mouse to the right edge of the window
  and draw the split screen separator back to the middle. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.1 ( December 2, 2005 )

* Fixed NullPointerExecption if workset.dtd was not found

* Fixed bug in copying workset.dtd to directory where a workset gets
  stored to

* Now based on pf.jar V3.1

* Added icon for desktop shortcuts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bugfix: Workset file wasn't closed after save

* workset.dtd will now be copied automatically to all new folders
  where a workset gets stored to

* Supports multiple placeholder replacement

* Supports searching for classes

* Packages are sorted per JAR/DIR in the tree view

* Classes are sorted per package in the tree view

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 0.8 ( February 1, 2004 )

* Provides a GUI that shows a hierarchy tree on the left
  (workset/container/package/class) and on the right a table with the
  dependencies of the selected class or package or container in the tree.

* Supports filters in Workset to define patterns
  for ignoring specific packages/classes
  (e.g. java.* ; javax.* ; com.sun.* )

* Supports dependency analysis on different levels:
  - class -> classes
  - class -> packages
  - class -> class containers
  - package -> classes
  - package -> packages
  - package -> class containers
  - class container -> classes
  - class container -> packages
  - class container -> class containers
